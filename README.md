# Custom-ORM-Framework
A custom hibernate like ORM framework built in core Java using Reflections and Annotations

1. In order to connect to a database, you need to add the database driver jar (library) to your classpath (external libraries) using your IDE
2. Download the driver jar from here - https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/
3. If you are using IntelliJ IDE, then you can add the jar to your classpath by following the below step
4. Go to the File -> Project Structure -> Libraries -> Add new Jar -> (Add the downloaded JAR)


I have used MySQL as the underlying database, you can use any database of your choice, but make sure to add the driver jar in the classpath of the project 
and change the JDBC url in the connection.
